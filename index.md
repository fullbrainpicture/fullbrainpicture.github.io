The human subcortex remains terra incognita, a largely uncharted territory. Long-term efforts and
advances in neuroanatomy, ultra-high field MRI, deep brain recording, and cognitive modeling are
painting a rich and varied picture, which has very direct implication in fundamental and clinical
neuroscience. This workshop aims to bring together some of the world's experts in the subcortex to
discuss recent results from multiple techniques and foster interactions within this often disregarded
region of the brain.
