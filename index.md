Brain are fascinating. For many years, I have studied the human brain with magnetic resonance imaging, microscopy, and computational methods, building dedicated software and elaborate pipelines along the way. Now, I am offering my expertise as a service to other researchers, to help the neuroimaging research community more widely and directly. If you are interested in my <a href="#code">expertise</a>, see what <a href="#code">services</a> I offer and <a href="#code">get in touch</a>!

- _Scientific consulting:_ Sometimes you just need to discuss an idea, get some external viewpoint or expert advice. Maybe I can help!

- _Image analysis pipelines:_ Setting up the right processing steps in the right order for a neuroimaging pipeline is often daunting. I have a lot of experience doing it right (and doing it wrong too sometimes), so I can save a lot of time and avoid many problems for you.

- _Methods development:_ When you are working with brand new imaging techniques or measuring something new, there often isn't the right toolbox ready for you. I have created many customized tools using optimized algorithms to extract information from novel images, and I always welcome a new challenge.

- _Training and tutorials:_ Once you have the right methods ready to analyze your imagign data, you still want to understand what it does, and what it doesn't. Maybe you want to use it new data later on, or try different parameters. I can guide you through the techniques, map their limitations, and explain their important parameters so that you canmaster them yourself.

-*(ultra-)high-resolution MRI* If you're aiming (well) below the millimeter, many toolboxes will not like you.

-_brain parcellation: cortical layers, subcortex, cerebellum_ 
All of the brain, all of the time.

_quantitative MRI analysis_
Quantitative techniques are very powerful, but require a bit more than a button press on the scanner.

_computational neuroanatomy_ 
Measuring shape is not easy.

## <a names="philosophy"></a>Philosophy

#### 100% open science, all the way.
Science only works when it is shared: this is how I have approached my work, from the first open software I released in 2001.
All my work uses and generates open source software. I strive to publish high quality open data sets, software and articles.
Would you like to do the same, but you're not sure where to start? I'll be happy to help, get in touch. Open science is not
only good for the scientific community at large, it also makes it easier to show off your work and start collaborations.
