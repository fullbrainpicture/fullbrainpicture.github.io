The human subcortex remains terra incognita, a largely uncharted territory. Long-term efforts and
advances in neuroanatomy, ultra-high field MRI, deep brain recording, and cognitive modeling are
painting a rich and varied picture, which has very direct implication in fundamental and clinical
neuroscience. This workshop aims to bring together some of the world's experts in the subcortex to
discuss recent results from multiple techniques and foster interactions within this often disregarded
region of the brain.

# 100% open science, all the way.
Science only works when it is shared: this is how I have approached my work, from the first open software I released in 2001.
All my work uses and generates open source software. I strive to publish high quality open data sets, software and articles.
Would you like to do the same, but you're not sure where to start? I'll be happy to help, get in touch. Open science is not
only good for the scientific community at large, it also makes it easier to show off your work and start collaborations.
