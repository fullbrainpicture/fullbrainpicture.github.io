Brains are fascinating. For many years, I have studied the human brain with magnetic resonance imaging, microscopy, and computational methods, building dedicated software and elaborate pipelines along the way. Now, I am offering my expertise as a service to other scientists, to help the neuroimaging research community more widely and directly. If you are interested in my <a href="#code">expertise</a>, see what <a href="#code">services</a> I offer and <a href="#code">get in touch</a>!

- _Scientific consulting:_ Sometimes you just need to discuss an idea, get an external viewpoint, or expert advice. Either way, I can help!

- _Image analysis pipelines:_ Setting up the right processing steps in the right order for a neuroimaging pipeline is often daunting. I have a lot of experience doing it right (and doing it wrong too sometimes), so I can save a lot of time and avoid many problems for you.

- _Methods development:_ When you are working with brand new imaging techniques or measuring something new, there often isn't the right toolbox ready for you. I have created many customized tools using optimized algorithms to extract information from novel images, and I always welcome a new challenge.

- _Training and tutorials:_ Once you have the right methods ready to analyze your imaging data, you still want to understand what it does, and what it doesn't. Maybe you want to use it with new data later on, or try different parameters. I can guide you through the techniques, map their limitations, and explain their important parameters so that you can master them yourself.

**(ultra-)High-resolution MRI** If you're aiming (well) below the millimeter, many toolboxes will not like you. I have built the first ultra-high field processing toolbox, Nighres, using carefully optimized methods to control complexity and scalability, from 1 millimeter to 200 microns so far.

**Brain parcellation: cortical layers, subcortex, cerebellum, vasculature** All of the brain, all of the time. I have developed dedicated analysis techniques to better model cortical lamination and folding, label many subcortical nuclei, approximate the cerebellar surface, or reconstruct vascular trees, based on MRI contrasts, knowledge priors, and computational techniques that bring them together.

**Quantitative MRI analysis** Quantitative techniques are very powerful, but require a bit more than a button press on the scanner. I have experience with combining MR images into quantitative estimates, and taking advantage of the intermediate images for lowering the impact of noise and artifacts.

**Computational neuroanatomy** Measuring the brain is not trivial. With computational geometry and topology techniques, I have quantified structure thickness, modelled topological relationships, or extracted pathological signals and patterns from brain MRI.

## <a names="philosophy"></a>Philosophy

**100% open science, all the way.**
Science only works when it is shared: this is how I have approached my work, from the first open software I released in 2001.
All my work uses and generates open source software. I strive to publish high quality open data sets, software and articles.
Would you like to do the same, but you're not sure where to start? I'll be happy to help, get in touch. Open science is not
only good for the scientific community at large, it also makes it easier to show off your work and start collaborations.
